## Evaluation Plan

### Observational Technique - Cooperative Evaluation

- Analyst and participant evaluate the game together.
- Identified problems and potential solutions are discussed together with participants.
- Questions to ask participants:
   - How did the atmosphere of the game make you feel throughout your gameplay experience?
   - What aspect of the game stood out to you the most?
   - Was there any moment where you felt confused or uncertain about what to do next?
   - How did the eerie elements (SFX) affect your exploration of the game environment?
   - How are the controls?
   - What do you like most about our game?
   - What do you think could be improved?
   - What do you think of the difficulty of the game?
   - What do you think the game is lacking to achieve a more eerie effect?
   - What part of the game do you think is the most engaging? What part feels boring?
   - Were there any moments where the atmosphere didnâ€™t feel eerie/unsettling? What contributed to that?
   - What are your thoughts when balancing your sanity bar and crafting light sources in the game? Did you face any challenges?

### Query Technique - Questionnaire

- Participants will play the game on WebGL and fill out a survey form.
- The survey form will include sections to rate various aspects of the gameplay and give text feedback.
-  Things we want feedback/ratings on:
   - How does the player feel whilst playing the game?
   - What do they think about the sanity system (does it stress them out)?
   - Does the player feel incentivized to craft light sources?
- Link to questionnaire: https://forms.gle/CN99nJRuxXeCCNT59

## Evaluation Report

In total, we conducted 7 surveys for a query technique, and 7 cooperative evaluations for an observation technique.

The raw data for survey is here [survey raw data](EvaluationData/Survey_raw.pdf)
The observation note is here [observation note raw data](EvaluationData/Observation_raw.pdf)

### Quantitative Data
This is the average score from the survey for each category. (1-5 scaling)

| Category   | Average Score | Scaling                   | Note                                        |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Enjoyment  | 3.57/5        | Higher = Very enjoyable   |                                             |
| Difficulty | 4/5           | Higher = Difficult        |                                             |
| Control    | 3.14/5        | Higher = Easy control     | The major problem is the camera control     |
| UI Layout  | 3.29/5        | Higher = Easy to navigate | The layout is simple but has some problems. |
| Audio      | 3.57/5        | Higher = Satisfy          |                                             |
| Graphic    | 3.43/5        | Higher = Satisfy          |                                             |
| Story      | 3.43/5        | Higher = Like the story   |                                             |

To summarise, the score shows that we need to improve our game in many aspects. The difficulty is quite high which impacts the overall enjoyment of gameplay. The camera control has too high sensitivity and is difficult to control using right-click. We will discuss the problems with UI later in the next section. Audio, graphics, and story, overall are acceptable because these categories are subjective and it happened when the participants might not like the art style or did not even care about the story.

### Qualitative Data
This data was gathered from the observation and survey questionnaires. We categorised the findings into 6 main themes.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./ReportImages/AD1.jpg" width="600"/>
</div>

The text in the tutorial was slow causing some participants to ignore the tutorial and the starting tutorial did not explain all the game mechanics. All details were in the guidebook which some participants were difficult to locate. We increased the text speed and we make pan the camera to the castle so the players know there is a castle to explore.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./ReportImages/AD2.jpg" width="600"/>
</div>

Due to high difficulty at the beginning of the game, participants feel difficult and frustrated. They said that the difficulty of the game was unbalanced. To mitigate this, we reduced the starting difficulty of the game.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./ReportImages/AD3.jpg" width="600"/>
</div>

Most participants stated that the graphic was unclear about the crafting resources. The UI layout of the crafting system is also unclear. We updated some sprites and add labels for crafting resources in the game so they can understand what kind of resources they have.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./ReportImages/AD4.jpg" width="600"/>
</div>

Participants feel confused about how to play the game because they could not understand the mechanic at first. Some mechanics are confusing and difficult to understand, so we added some additional tutorials and explained them.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./ReportImages/AD5.jpg" width="600"/>
</div>

Almost all participants loved the theme and the concept of the game. They said that the dark theme is interesting and they feel great to explore the castle.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./ReportImages/AD6.jpg" width="600"/>
</div>

We found some bugs in the playtest.
